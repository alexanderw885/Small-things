# Laptop Class Prep
simple project designed to prepare my laptop for each class. This consists of two separate steps
1. Exit unnecessary programs to save battery, notably Steam and Spotify
2. Open Chrome and my notetaking program Obsidian, split screen, with Chrome on the Uvic login page

This was done with multi-threading to simultaniously open any programs and close others in C, as well as some basic bash scripts for window management
